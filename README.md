# WeMeet
WeHack23 project 

In order to encourage understanding, diversity, and inclusion, we have developed an app to host and attend in-person and virtual activities, gatherings, and events for many types of people and communities. As the world becomes more interconnected, we feel that it's important to encourage others to immerse themselves in a foreign culture. This app is designed to introduce people to different cultures and to provide opportunities for people to experience other people's perspectives in their lives. We hope to give a chance to try new experiences and broaden their world views.
